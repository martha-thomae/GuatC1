# Mass 07 (f.31v-43r) - Missa sine nomine - Palestrina



## Kyrie
### Full Movement

No Editorial corrections

Remaining orange labels after editorial corrections:
- One in Superius (Kyrie I at the end), **rearticulation**

NOTE: Weird accidental in tenor, an A# (the sharp is physically written), but disonant against the other As sounding in the other two voices. This Kyrie II is different from that on Missarum Liber 2dus, so I cannot compare it to it. Probably the sharp in the A (tenor) is a mistake (so far only G has sharps).

NOTE: The ending is also weird (tenor). (Check your article for a better solution.)
