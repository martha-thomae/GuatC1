# Mass 12 (f.95v-109r) - Missa Ave maris stella - Tomas Luis de Victoria



## Kyrie
### Full Movement

1. Editorial correction:
- Change dotted semibreve (preceding two fusas) to a dotted minim. There is another hand that seem to have done this same correction. Works good!

2. No remaining orange labels after correction

3. Has been revised against CPDL? Not yet


## Gloria
### First Section

1. No editorial corrections (for now).

2. Only one unexplained orange label since the beginning (screenshot; other are rearticulations, or other agents).

3. Has been revised against CPDL? Not yet


### Second Section

1. Editorial correction:
- All good until page turn (lines up); so the issue is after. I cut a semibreve in the tenor to a minim. Works good! And it is also found in the manuscript as a second hand.

2. One remaining orange label: not so bad as it is a weak beat (and it chagnes to a blue 'V' when the anticipation on the top voice is changed to a single note value). All others (plenty) are gone.

3. Has been revised against CPDL? Not yet



## Credo
### Sections 1 & 2
First page turn, all good (all lining up) at page turn. Looking after there.
1. Editorial corrections (section 1):
- Change a minim after a dotted minim into a semiminim (in altus)
- Change semibreves to breves (in superius and tenor) before the single barline in the manuscript (the barline with the custos) and before the double barline preceding section 2 (same corr as in IMSLP).
 No editorial corrections (section 2)
2. Orange labels left:
- Two rearticulations (section 1) + Another rearticulation (section 2)
3. Reviewed against IMSLP (from other source) for section 1, but not for section 2

### Section 3
1. Editorial corrections: 
- Tenor minim in B moved up to D (same corr as in IMSLP)
2. No orange label left after corrections.
3. Has been revised against CPDL? YES, IMSLP from other source.

### Section 4
1. No corrections
2. No true orange labels left (two rearticulations and one short note acting as a second agent)
3. Has been revised against CPDL? Not yet



## Sanctus
### Section 1
1. No corrections
2. Only one orange label left which is a short note that also acts as a secondary agent (double agent short note).
3. Has been revised against CPDL? Not yet

### Section 2 (Triple meter section)
Notes:
- Rests are interpreted differently:
 - Superius with breve and semibreve rest = a single perfect breve rest (3 semibreves)
 - Bassus with longa and breve rest = six semibreve rests (or two perfect breve rests)
- Superius undotted breve is imperfect breve that falls in the third beat of the measure, rather than have an alteration preceding it. All breves are imperfect (unless dotted with a dot acting as dot of perfection) and there is no alterations --> JUST LIKE YOUR NOTES ON XVI C. MENSURAL MUSIC YOU WROTE ON YOUR THESIS.
- Colored breve and two-note ligature is three colored breves long.

### Section 3
1. No corrections
2. No orange labels since the beginning
3. Has been revised against CPDL? Not yet



## Agnus
### Full Movement
1. Detected an OMR error in the bass (a breve rest that should have been a semibreve rest following the first longa rest of the voice)
2. After the OMR correction:
- Two orange labels due to the alto behaving as bass and forming a fourth with the superius. I fixed this by moving the dotted minim G down a second (having the same pitch as the following semiminim); and then fixed the G minim close by (as bit after) down a second (having the same pitch as the previous note).
 We could leave the notes as they are, as it is in IMSLP Agnus I. However that version in IMSLP has other voices below. So what to do?????
- Then only two **rearticulations** are left as orange labels following correction.
3. Has been revised against CPDL? ????
