# Mass 12 (f.95v-109r) - Missa Ave maris stella - Tomas Luis de Victoria



## Kyrie
### Full Movement

1. Editorial correction:
- Change dotted semibreve (preceding two fusas) to a dotted minim. There is another hand that seem to have done this same correction. Works good!

2. No remaining orange labels after correction

3. Has been revised against CPDL? Not yet


## Gloria
### First Section

1. No editorial corrections (for now).

2. Only one unexplained orange label since the beginning (screenshot; other are rearticulations, or other agents).

3. Has been revised against CPDL? Not yet


### Second Section

1. Editorial correction:
- All good until page turn (lines up); so the issue is after. I cut a semibreve in the tenor to a minim. Works good! And it is also found in the manuscript as a second hand.

2. One remaining orange label: not so bad as it is a weak beat (and it chagnes to a blue 'V' when the anticipation on the top voice is changed to a single note value). All others (plenty) are gone.

3. Has been revised against CPDL? Not yet
