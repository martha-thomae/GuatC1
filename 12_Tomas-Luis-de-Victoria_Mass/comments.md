# Mass 12 (f.95v-109r) - Missa Ave maris stella - Tomas Luis de Victoria



## Kyrie
### Full Movement

1. Editorial correction:
- Change dotted semibreve (preceding two fusas) to a dotted minim. There is another hand that seem to have done this same correction. Works good!

2. No remaining orange labels after correction

3. Has been revised against CPDL? Not yet


## Gloria
### First Section

1. No editorial corrections (for now).

2. Only one unexplained orange label since the beginning (screenshot; other are rearticulations, or other agents).

3. Has been revised against CPDL? Not yet


### Second Section

1. Editorial correction:
- All good until page turn (lines up); so the issue is after. I cut a semibreve in the tenor to a minim. Works good! And it is also found in the manuscript as a second hand.

2. One remaining orange label: not so bad as it is a weak beat (and it chagnes to a blue 'V' when the anticipation on the top voice is changed to a single note value). All others (plenty) are gone.

3. Has been revised against CPDL? Not yet



## Credo
### Section 1

First page turn, all good (all lining up) at page turn. Looking after there.

### Section 2

### Section 3

### Section 4
1. No corrections
2. No true orange labels left (two rearticulations and one short note acting as a second agent)
3. Has been revised against CPDL? Not yet



## Sanctus
### Section 1
1. No corrections
2. Only one orange label left which is a short note that also acts as a secondary agent (double agent short note).
3. Has been revised against CPDL? Not yet

### Section 2

### Section 3
1. No corrections
2. No orange labels since the beginning
3. Has been revised against CPDL? Not yet



## Agnus
### Full Movement
1. Detected an OMR error in the bass (a breve rest that should have been a semibreve rest following the first longa rest of the voice)
2. Only two **rearticulations** are left as orange labels following correction. BUT AFTER OMR CORRECTION WE HAVE THREE NEW ORANGE LABELS AT THE BEGINNING (WITH THE ALTUS): One is a doubling of the agent by a short note (which is ok), the other two are not explainable.
3. Has been revised against CPDL? Not yet
