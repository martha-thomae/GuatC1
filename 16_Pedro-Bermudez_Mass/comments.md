# Mass 16 (f.152v-169r) - Missa de Bomba - Pedro Bermudez



## Kyrie (Full Movement)
### Kyrie I
1. Shorten the last note of the superius
2. No orange labels since the beginning
3. Fully revised against CPDL (with last note as OMR error)

### Christe
1. Extend last note of altus and shorten last note of tenor OR to be able to finish at the right time before next section, shorten all notes to (**sb, dotted breve, sb, and sb** when originals were breve, breve, breve, and longa) **[OR EQUIVALENT IN DURATION TO DOTTED BREVE, LONGA PLUS SB, DOTTED BREVE, AND DOTTED BREVE]**
2. No orange labels left.
3. Fully revised against CPDL

### Kyrie II
1. Shorten last note in superius, tenor, and bassus (from breve to semibreve)
2. No orange labels left
3. Fully revised against CPDL


## Gloria
### Section 1
1. No corrections
2. Three orange labels: two are either a rearticulation or weak beat, and the third one (an orange 'z' in the tenor, closer to the beginning) is a short agent (not detected as such, it is actually then heard in the bass, and it is in CPDL too).
3. Fully revised against CPDL

### Section 2
#### 1st) Before the triple-meter subsection A
1. No corrections (just expanded the last note in all voices from sb to breve to finish at the end of the measure --> decision @num/numbase = 1/2 for last semibreves).
2. No orange labels in the first place
3. Fully checked with CPDL

#### 2nd) At triple-meter subsection A
1. No corrections
2. Didn't use orange labels (triple-meter issue in \*\*mens)
3. Fully checked and preferred my version as it follows the rule "simile ante simile"

### 3rd) Before the triple-meter subsection B
1. No corrections (decision @num/numbase = 1/2 for last semibreves and 2/3 for breves to get to the end of the measure).
2. No orange labels in the first place
3. Fully checked with CPDL

### 4th) At triple-meter subsection B
1. No corrections, but had to add a hemiola coloration three-semibreve group in the MuRET file in the alto which was added by a second hand in the mss.
    - NOTE: I added a breve at the end in the mean time so that the triple meter sections were processed properly within the MP Editor, but I erased them afterwards. AND had to change also (manual postprocess) how the two minim rests in the same staffline of the superius affect the previous semibreve (leaving it perfect).
2. Didn't use orange labels (triple-meter issue in \*\*mens)
3. Fully checked with CPDL

### 5th) After triple-meter subsection B
1. No corrections, I processed with previous (4th) and I changed the barring manually afterwards
2. Didn't use orange labels (super-short passage)
3. Fully checked with CPDL


## Credo
### Section 1
#### 1st) Before the triple-meter subsection
1. No corrections
2. One orange label I cannot explain in the superius close to the beginning
3. 

#### 2nd) At triple-meter subsection
1. No corrections
2. Didn't check orange labels (triple meter issue in \*\*mens)
3. Fully revised against CPDL

#### 3rd) After the triple-meter subsection
1. No real editorial corrections, just change the last note of the voices for them to finish simultaneously. The ending note values for this are breve (as it was), longa+dotted breve (it was just the longa), dotted breve (it was a longa), dotted breve (it was a breve). IN THE END, I MANUALLY POSTPROCESS THE ORIGINAL NOTES WITH NUM/NUMBASE ATTRIBUTES TO HAVE THE RIGHT DURATION (UNTIL THE END).
2. The change eliminated all orange labels
3. 


### Section 2
#### 1st) Before the triple-meter subsection
1. OMR error: missing a dot after a minim (161r, p1, s7). Manuscript error in clefs for part of the tenor, had to move notes up a third in pitch class (and also change the clef to C3 for consistency).
2. One orange label, a **rearticulation**.
3.


#### 2nd) At triple-meter subsection
1. The MP Editor script is performing alterations when there are two minims between semibreves; but this is a later piece and it should interpret the semibreves as imperfect by default (rather than perfect by default), basically as in earlier Renaissance where there is a dot of division. So, editorial correction was a dot of division.
2. Didn't check orange labels (triple meter issue in \*\*mens)
3.

#### 3rd) After the triple-meter subsection
1. No corrections
2. One orange label at the level of the fusa (irrelevant)
3. Maybe not necessary to check against CPDL


### Section 3
MISSING


## Sanctus
### Section 1
1. Extend last note in the altus (from longa to dotted longa)
2. No orange labels remaining after the change
3. Fully checked against CPDL

### Section 2
1. Editorial corrections --> more like extensions of the last notes (by adding perfect dots to the last notes) 
    - Extend last note in bassus (there is an extra "Hosanna in excelsis" phrase in the CPDL score before this longa). Convert the imperfect longa into a perfect longa by dotting it. Then: perfect longa = 3 imperfect breve = 3 (2 perfect semibreves) = 6 perfect semibreves = 6 measures
    - Add a dot of perfection to the last breve in the altus (to change it from an imperfect breve---made up of two perfect semibreves---to a perfect breve---made up of 3 PERFECT Semibreves).
2. I didn't evaluate orange labels as this is a triple meter section (issue in \*\*mens)
3. Fully checked against CPDL

### Section 3
1. Editorial correction: altus needed an extra semibreve very early on. In CPDL they add the semibreve in measure 5 (barred by the breve). On the other hand, I incremented a semibreve that was two notes after that to a breve (end of measure 5 and going to 6). Both seem fine, but **WHICH SOLUTION IS BETTER???** Maybe theirs as it implies smaller note values???
2. No orange labels
3. Checked with CPDL until some point


## Agnus (Full Movement)
1. Shorten last note in superius, tenor, and bassus to finish at the same time and at the end of the 'measure'
2. No orange labels left
3. Fully checked against CPDL
