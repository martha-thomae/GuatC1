### Kyrie I
1. Shorten the last note of the superius
2. No orange labels since the beginning
3. Fully revised against CPDL (with last note as OMR error)

### Christe
1. Extend last note of altus and shorten last note of tenor OR to be able to finish at the right time before next section, shorten all notes to (**sb, dotted breve, sb, and sb** when originals were breve, breve, breve, and longa) **[OR EQUIVALENT IN DURATION TO DOTTED BREVE, LONGA PLUS SB, DOTTED BREVE, AND DOTTED BREVE]**
2. No orange labels left.

2. No orange labels left
3. Fully revised against CPDL


## Gloria
### Section 1
1. No corrections
2. Three orange labels: two are either a rearticulation or weak beat, and the third one (an orange 'z' in the tenor, closer to the beginning) is a short agent (not detected as such, it is actually then heard in the bass, and it is in CPDL too).
3. Fully revised against CPDL

MISSING

### Section 3
MISSING


## Sanctus
### Section 1
1. Extend last note in the altus (from longa to dotted longa)
2. No orange labels remaining after the change
3. Fully checked against CPDL

### Section 2
1. Editorial corrections --> more like extensions of the last notes (by adding perfect dots to the last notes) 
    - Extend last note in bassus (there is an extra "Hosanna in excelsis" phrase in the CPDL score before this longa). Convert the imperfect longa into a perfect longa by dotting it. Then: perfect longa = 3 imperfect breve = 3 (2 perfect semibreves) = 6 perfect semibreves = 6 measures
    - Add a dot of perfection to the last breve in the altus (to change it from an imperfect breve---made up of two perfect semibreves---to a perfect breve---made up of 3 PERFECT Semibreves).
2. I didn't evaluate orange labels as this is a triple meter section (issue in \*\*mens)
3. Fully checked against CPDL

### Section 3
1. Editorial correction: altus needed an extra semibreve very early on. In CPDL they add the semibreve in measure 5 (barred by the breve). On the other hand, I incremented a semibreve that was two notes after that to a breve (end of measure 5 and going to 6). Both seem fine, but **WHICH SOLUTION IS BETTER???** Maybe theirs as it implies smaller note values???
2. No orange labels
3. Checked with CPDL until some point


## Agnus (Full Movement)
1. Shorten last note in superius, tenor, and bassus to finish at the same time and at the end of the 'measure'
2. No orange labels left
3. Fully checked against CPDL
