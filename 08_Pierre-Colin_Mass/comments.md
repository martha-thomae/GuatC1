# Mass 08 (f.43v-54r) - Missa Pere de nous - Pierre Colin



## Kyrie
### Full Movement

No editorial corrections

No orange labels in the first place

**CONSULT: The places with an Eb still sound weird.
I corrected lots of gestural accidentals and (with on exception) I think the piece sounds better. Same as CPDL one in those parts too. I added all the gestural accids implied by the key signatures and by accid cancellations, and doesn't sound that bad now.**


## Gloria
### Full Movement

Editorial corrections:
- Replace semibreve by minim in Altus (measure 21)

Remaining orange labels after editorial corrections:
- One in Tenor, **rearticulation**
- One in Superius, **?**

**CONSULT: Antepenultimate measure sounds wrong! Again with the Eb happening. It is the same as the CPDL one, and doesn't sound that bad now that I have corrected other parts that implied cancellation of flat accidentals in the key signature.**
