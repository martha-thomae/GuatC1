# Mass 08 (f.43v-54r) - Missa Pere de nous - Pierre Colin



## Kyrie
### Full Movement

No editorial corrections

## Gloria
### Full Movement

Editorial corrections:

Remaining orange labels after editorial corrections:

- One in Superius, **?**


## Credo 
### Section 1 & 2 (Patrem omnipotentem & Et incarnatus)

Editorial corrections:
- Add semibreve rest in Tenor, betweeen longa and minim rest (measure 3)

Remaining orange labels after editorial corrections:
- Two in Superius, **?**


### Sections 3 (Crucifixus)

Editorial corrections:
- Remove augmentation dot in semibreve in the Tenor (measure 11-12)

**Check if this edit is alright, or if the previous rests are the ones to be removed or reduced.**

***We have a cadence to C in measures 6 to 7 (Superius & Alto & Tenor), then a cadence to F in measures 9 to 10 (Alto & Tenor), and then a misaligned cadence to F in measures 13 to 14 (Superius & Tenor). The issue must be between the last two cadences (between measures 10 and 14, the edit of reducing a minim could apply to the note I changed or to the rests)***

Remaining orange labels after editorial corrections:
- Two, one in Superius and one in Tenor, both are **rearticulations**


### Section 4 (Et iterum venturus est)

Editorial corrections:
- Remove augmentation dot in dotted semibreve in Superius (measure 15-16)
