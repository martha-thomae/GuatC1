# Mass 17 (f.169v-180r) - Missa sine nomine - Juan Matias de Rivera



## Kyrie
### Full Movement
1. In each section expanded the last note from a breve to a dotted breve (just for the purposes of filling the measure before the next section or the end)
2. One orange label in the tenor (a syncopated semibreve between two minims), unexplainable in Kyrie II. It was there even before the extension of the last notes. It is present in CPDL too. It is an orange 'z' given the fourth of the tenor (c) with the bass (g, that also is present in the superius). The three voices would make a C chord (as there is an 'e' in the altus).
3. Fully checked against CPDL.



## Gloria
### Section 1
1. Expanded the last note of the section from a breve to a dotted breve (just for the purposes of filling the measure before the next section).
2. No orange labels since the beginning.
3. Fully checked against CPDL.

### Section 2
1. Expanded the last note of the section from a breve to a dotted breve (just for the purposes of filling the measure before the next section).
2. No orange labels since the beginning.
3. Fully checked against CPDL (unimportant difference with a note down a third, that doesn't affect any of the dissonance labels, so it is best to stick to the mss as I did).



## Credo
### Section 1
1. Seems fine as it is, so no corrections except to enlarge the final semibreve of all voices by a factor of 2/1, because they don't end at the end of the measure. Left in CPDL too.
2. One orange unexplainable dissonance in the superius (last minim of the 2nd system in 173v).
3. Fully checked against CPDL.

### Section 2
1. Seems fine as it is, so no corrections.
2. One orange unexplainable dissonance in the tenor (a syncopated semibreve between two minims, in the middle of the 7th system in 174v). Left in CPDL too.
3. Fully checked against CPDL.

### Section 3
1. Only shorten the last note of the three lowest voices from a breve to a semibreve so that they end with the superius (or, equivalenty reducing these breves by a factor of 1/2). The arrival at the cadence seems to be fine.
2. No orange labels left.
3. Fully checked against CPDL (two unimportant differences in pitch).

### Section 4
1. Missing one semiminima in the superius --> OMR error, there was a dot in the fifth system of 175v affecting the last minim of previous system (preceding the three semiminims in the fifth system).
2. No orange labels left.
3. Fully checked against CPDL.


## Sanctus
### Section 1
1. Extended last note of the superius to finish at the end of the measure (from breve to dotted breve) like the other voices do. Same corr found in cpdl.
2. One orange label that wasn't eliminated by this in the tenor, this a syncopated semibreve (with a minim preceding and following) between measures. Unexplainable as it is a fourth over the bass and while it starts on the weak beat of one measures continues on the strong beat of the next measure.
3. Fully checked against CPDL.

### Section 2
1. Editorial corrections:
    - The one breve closer to the beginning of the altus (measure 6), move it down by a second to eliminate orange label. (Same corr in cpdl.) The orange labels left there now are all due to rearticulations as can be shown in the corresponding image.
    - Expanded the last note of the section from a breve to a dotted breve (just for the purposes of filling the measure before the next section).
2. All orange labels are now **rearticulations**
3. Fully checked against CPDL.



## Agnus (Full Movement)
1. Expanded the last notes of the section from a breve to a dotted breve (just for the purposes of filling the measure before the next section).
2. One orange label remaining, but it is a **rearticulation**
3. Fully checked against CPDL.
