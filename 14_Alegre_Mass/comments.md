# Mass 14 (f.119v-133r) - Missa de 4to tono - Alegre



## Kyrie
### Kyrie I (Section 1)

1. Editorial correction:
- Shorten the fourth to last note in the altus (from semibreve to minim).

2. No remaining orange labels after correction

3. Has been revised against CPDL? For the changes only.


### Christe (Section 2)

1. No editorial corrections.

2. One remaining orange label (also in cpdl), and two rearticulations.

3. Has been revised against CPDL? Yes, until the orange label, all good.


### Kyrie II (Section 3)

1. Editorial correction: Not really
- Only shorten the last note in the superius  (from breve to dotted semibreve) --> CPDL dots the semibreve that is third to last note [same effect on orange labels] --> PICKED CPDL SOLUTION

2. No orange labels since the beginning

3. Has been revised against CPDL? For the changes only.



## Gloria
### Section 1

1. OMR error, a dot that was at the very beginning of the third staff of the bassus, affecting the previous minim that is at the end of staff 2.

Another, a tie missing in superius (from 121v to 122v), and another tie in bassus (122r to 123r)

Make last note longer in the bassus.

2. Orange labels left are either:
- reaticulations
- Or seventh chords (E, G, [B], D and then D, F, A, C) (D, F#, A, C)

3. Revised against CPDL (seems good, CPDL has the same orange labels, and has corrs where it is not needed). FULL REVISED AGAINST CPDL.


### Section 2

1. Error in superius, two semibreves should be minims (corrected by a second hand in the manuscript) [123v, s1].

And extend the last note in the altus (with a dot on the breve), and in the tenor and bassus (by changing breve to longa).

2. Orange labels left: many

3. Revised against CPDL (seems good, CPDL has the same orange labels, and has corrs where it is not needed).




## Sanctus (Full Movement)
Only extend the last note in all voices from breve to dotted breve so that all voices finish at the end of the measure.

FULLY REVISED AGAINST CPDL --> PERFECT MATCH



## Agnus I
Extend last notes in altus (from longa to sb+longa), tenor (from breve to dotted breve), and bassus (from breve to dotted breve).

FULLY REVISED AGAINST CPDL --> ALMOST PERFECT MATCH (one diff better in the mss in the middle, another diff at the beginning of the bassus, but you decide which to follow---erasures or new)



## Agnus II
Shorten last note in superius (from breve to semibreve) to finish at the same time as the other voices.

FULLY REVISED AGAINST CPDL --> PERFECT MATCH



## Credo
### Section 1 & 2
Only fix the ending note of all voices of section 1 (before the single barline); these changes are: breve to longa in superius, semibreve to breve in tenor, and breve to dotted breve in bass. 

And finally shorten the last note of section 2 in the tenor from a longa to a dotted breve for a simultaneous ending of all four voices.

Two missing ties added in PARTS file (and SCORE).

FULLY CHECKED AGAINST CPDL. ALL GOOD. (Many orange labels left in both.) Just one difference with CPDL, but I followed the mss.


### Section 3
Just fix last note endings.
FULLY CHECKED AGAINST CPDL. ALL GOOD.

### Section 4
- It was missing a tie in 127v to 128v in the tenor.
- Editorial correction, changed a breve to semibreve in altus f.129r, system 2.
- Extend last notes in superius and bassus to finish with other voices. Change in bassus: breve to dotted breve. Change in superius: maxima to maxima plus semibreve (I had to actually substitute the maxima by two longae just because there is no maximodus encoded).

FULLY CHECKED AGAINST CPDL, ALL GOOD.
