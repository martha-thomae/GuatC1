# Mass 14 (f.119v-133r) - Missa de 4to tono - Alegre



## Kyrie
### Kyrie I (Section 1)

1. Editorial correction:
- Shorten the fourth to last note in the altus (from semibreve to minim).

2. No remaining orange labels after correction

3. Has been revised against CPDL? For the changes only.


### Christe (Section 2)

1. No editorial corrections.

2. One remaining orange label (also in cpdl), and two rearticulations.

3. Has been revised against CPDL? Yes, until the orange label, all good.


### Kyrie II (Section 3)

1. Editorial correction: Not really
- Only shorten the last note in the superius  (from breve to dotted semibreve) --> CPDL dots the semibreve that is third to last note [same effect on orange labels] --> PICKED CPDL SOLUTION

2. No orange labels since the beginning

3. Has been revised against CPDL? For the changes only.



## Gloria
### Section 1

1. OMR error, a dot that was at the very beginning of the third staff of the bassus, affecting the previous minim that is at the end of staff 2.

Another, a tie missing in superius (from 121v to 122v), and another tie in bassus (122r to 123r)

Make last note longer in the bassus.

2. Orange labels left are either:
- reaticulations
- Or seventh chords (E, G, [B], D and then D, F, A, C) (D, F#, A, C)

3. Revised against CPDL (seems good, CPDL has the same orange labels, and has corrs where it is not needed).


### Section 2

1. Error in superius, two semibreves should be minims (corrected by a second hand in the manuscript) [123v, s1].

And extend the last note in the altus (with a dot on the breve), and in the tenor and bassus (by changing breve to longa).

2. Orange labels left: many

3. Revised against CPDL (seems good, CPDL has the same orange labels, and has corrs where it is not needed).
