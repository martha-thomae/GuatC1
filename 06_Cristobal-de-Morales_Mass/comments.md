## Kyrie
### Full Movement

Editorial corrections: not really

- Extend the last note of the Altus (Kyrie II)

Remaining orange labels after editorial corrections:

- Another in Tenor (Qui tollis peccata, measure 25), **?** 
 (A semiminim sounding against Gs in the altus and bassus, and against a B in the superius. This dissonant A semiminim is approached and left by a leap. ***This dissonant A semiminim in the tenor is kept in the CPDL transcription.***)



## Credo 
### Section 1 (Patrem omnipotentem)

No Editorial corrections

Remaining orange labels after editorial corrections:

- Two in Altus, **rearticulations**
- Another in Altus (near the end), **?**
 (D semiminim sounding against an A in the tenor, which as acting as the lowest voice, forming a fourth with the lowest voice; and sounding against a C in the superius. ***This dissonant D semiminim is approached and left by a leap.*** Same in CPDL.)


### Sections 2 & 3 (Et incarnatus est & Crucifixus)

Editorial corrections: not really
- Shorten the last note of the Tenor (Et incarnatus est)

Remaining orange labels after editorial corrections:
- One in the Tenor (Et incarnatus est, measure 8), *?* 
 (Same as in CPDL version. It seems like a upper neighbour expanded a bit, but isn't this like tying from a dissonance? [but it is not tied if barring by the breve])


### Section 4 (Et iterum venturus est)

No editorial corrections

Found a few OMR errors in the altus (breve a pitch off) and bassus (missing minim rest), so I returned to MuRET and corrected the errors

Remaining orange labels after editorial corrections:
- Two orange labels (tenor and bassus), **descending/ascending stepwise sequence of semiminims**
 (Same as in CPDL.)
