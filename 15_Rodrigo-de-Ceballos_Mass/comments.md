# Mass 15 (f.133v-152r) - Missa Simile est regnum caelorum - Rodrigo de Ceballos



## Kyrie (Full Movement)

1. No editorial corrections.

2. No orange labels in the first place.

3. I haven't revised it against anything.



## Gloria

Revised until a point.

Orange labels are acceptable (rearticulations, double agents, weak beats).



## Credo

### Section 1

It was missing the mensuration (semantics) in the bass since it didn't have a mensuration sign and MuRET doesn't allow yet to enter mensuration semantics in the semantic encoding (although \*\*mens does allow for it: e.g., \*met()\_2222)

One editorial correction at the beginning of alto (change semibreve rest to minim rest)

One orange label left (unexplained yet, but same as in CPDL)

Checked up until a point


### Section 2

Revised until a point.

Orange labels are acceptable (rearticulations, double agents, weak beats).


### Section 3

1. No editorial corrections.

2. No orange labels in the first place.

3. I haven't revised it against anything.


### Section 4

#### 1ST PART (before triple meter subsection):

1. No editorial corrections.
2. Only one orange label left, which is a **rearticulation**
3. Not revised

#### 2ND PART (triple meter subsection):
1. No editorial corrctions
2. Didn't look for orange labels here (triple meter issue)
3. Not revised

#### 3RD PART (following triple meter subsection):





## Sanctus

### Section 1

No editorial corrections, just shortening the last note in the altus. And no orange labels left after that.

Completely checked against CPDL (one difference, better mine as closer to the original and no change in labels).


### Section 2

Triple meter section, so I didn't use the Dissonant Filter. I added a dot of division as an editorial correction (but it was ok because it is a XVI c. piece and breves are interpreted as imperfect by default unless dotted or followed by a breve rest).

Fully revised against cpdl.


### Section 3

1. Editorial corrections:

    - Shorten dotted minim at the beginning of the bass by a minim (making it the first of a series of four semiminims). This correction is found in CPDL too. [I thought of shortening a previous semibreve to a minim, but a few accentuated dissonances appeared (should be marked in yello!). So the CPDL solution is better.]

    - And incrementing the length of the last note in the superius.

2. No orange labels left.

3. Checked against CPDL until a certain point.



### Agnus I (Full Movement)

1. No editorial corrections

2. No orange labels since the beginning

3. Fully checked against CPDL



### Agnus II (Full Movement)

1. Editorial corrections:
    - Shortening of the altus last note (altus II, third voice)
    - PITCH CORRECTION (local correction). Local 'Z' orange label in the superius, which was a B sounding against an A in the two lowest voices (and there was an E in the last voice). Moved it to a C (as in CPDL). I could have moved it to an A too, but the C was better as it allowed to approach the note by step (and then leave it by a leap in the opposite direction). 

2. No orange labels left

3. Fully checked against CPDL
