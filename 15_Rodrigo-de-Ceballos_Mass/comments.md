# Mass 15 (f.133v-152r) - Missa Simile est regnum caelorum - Rodrigo de Ceballos



## Kyrie (Full Movement)

1. No editorial corrections.

2. No orange labels in the first place.

3. I haven't revised it against anything.



## Gloria

Revised until a point.

Orange labels are acceptable (rearticulations, double agents, weak beats).



## Credo

### Section 1

It was missing the mensuration (semantics) in the bass since it didn't have a mensuration sign and MuRET doesn't allow yet to enter mensuration semantics in the semantic encoding (although \*\*mens does allow for it: e.g., \*met()\_2222)

One editorial correction at the beginning of alto (change semibreve rest to minim rest)

One orange label left (unexplained yet, but same as in CPDL)

Checked up until a point


### Section 2

Revised until a point.

Orange labels are acceptable (rearticulations, double agents, weak beats).


### Section 3

1. No editorial corrections.

2. No orange labels in the first place.

3. I haven't revised it against anything.
