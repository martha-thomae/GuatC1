# Mass 06 (f.17v-31r) - Missa sobre las vozes - Crist√≥bal de Morales



## Kyrie
### Full Movement

Editorial corrections: not really
- Extend the last note of the Superius, Altus, and Bassus (Kyrie I)
- Extend the last note of the Altus (Christe)
- Shorten semibreve to minim in Tenor (Kyrie II, five measures before end)

Remaining orange labels after editorial corrections:
- One in Superius (Kyrie II, at the end)
- One in Altus (Kyrie II, measure 4)
Both are **rearticulations** of the same pitch in the given voice



## Gloria
### Section 1 (Et in terra pax)

....


### Section 2 (Qui tollis peccata mundi)

No editorial corrections

Remaining orange labels:
- One in Altus and one in Bassus (four measures from the end), both **rearticulations** (which are actually behaving as agents)


## Credo 
### Section 1 (Patrem omnipotentem)

No editorial corrections

Remaining orange labels:
- One in Bassus (measure 8) and one in Tenor (measure 12 from the end), both **rearticulations**
- One in Altus (measure 12), it is marked as illegal because the tenor is behaving as the lowest voice with an E, and the altus is sounding a fourth above (an A). However, the orange label is not relevant if one thinks of the bass as a continuous note (uninterrupted by the rests).


### Sections 2 (Et incarnatus est)

Editorial corrections: not really
- Shorten last note in the Tenor

No orange labels remaining after editorial corrections


### Section 3 (Crucifixus)
