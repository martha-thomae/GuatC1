# Mass 09 (f.54v-71r) - Missa de 3er tono - Rodrigo de Ceballos



## Kyrie
### Full Movement

Editorial corrections: not really
- Extend the last note of the Superius, Altus, and Bassus (Kyrie I)
- Extend the last note of the Altus (Christe)
- Shorten semibreve to minim in Tenor (Kyrie II, five measures before end)

Remaining orange labels after editorial corrections:
- One in Superius (Kyrie II, at the end)
- One in Altus (Kyrie II, measure 4)
Both are **rearticulations** of the same pitch in the given voice



## Gloria
### Section 1 (Et in terra pax)

Editorial correction:
- Missing semibreve rest (measure 6) before minim rest in the Bassus. One can see it added in the manuscript by a second hand.

No remaining orange labels after editorial corrections

**Note for myself in terms of how I was able to find this error:**
Cadences didn't help me personally in this case. So I used page turns as places for voices to coincide (could do it with fermatas or congruence signs I guess). After that, I could look for the 1st place where the series of orange labels appear, and found it is around measure 6 so we try to find the error in the bass before that point.

Another way could be noticing that extending the last note is not enough to remove the series of orange labels, therefore we look for the 1st place where the series of orange labels appear, and found it is around measure 6 so we try to find the error in the bass before that point.


### Section 2 (Qui tollis peccata mundi)

No editorial corrections

Remaining orange labels:
- One in Altus and one in Bassus (four measures from the end), both **rearticulations** (which are actually behaving as agents)


## Credo 
### Section 1 (Patrem omnipotentem)

No editorial corrections

Remaining orange labels:
- One in Bassus (measure 8) and one in Tenor (measure 12 from the end), both **rearticulations**
- One in Altus (measure 12), it is marked as illegal because the tenor is behaving as the lowest voice with an E, and the altus is sounding a fourth above (an A). However, the orange label is not relevant if one thinks of the bass as a continuous note (uninterrupted by the rests).


### Sections 2 (Et incarnatus est)

Editorial corrections: not really
- Shorten last note in the Tenor

No orange labels remaining after editorial corrections


### Section 3 (Crucifixus)

Editorial corrections: not really
- Extend last note in the Tenor
 **[IN CPDL, THEY DIDN'T EXTEND THAT NOTE. THEY ADDED A SEMIBREVE QUITE A FEW MEASURES BEFORE. IN MEASURE 26, AFTER THE TWO MINIMS IN G AND A (AND BEFORE THE MINIM REST), THEY ADDED A SEMIBREVE IN B-FLAT AN OCTAVE BELOW] YOU SHOULD CHECK IF THIS GETS RID OF THE WEIRD ORANGE LABELS YOU HAVE IN MEASURE 27 AND 31**

Remaining orange labels:
- One in the Tenor (measure 14), one in the Superius and Bassus (measure 27), **rearticulation**
- One in Tenor (measure 27) and one in the Bassus (measure 31), **? - we could move the minim in measure 27 in the altus up or down to remove that dissonance (the tenor seems to be following a pattern) OR leave it and think of it as a G7. Measure 31 looks ok: D, F, A; but the tenor's D is forming a FOURTH ABOVE THE BASS's A. REV AGAINST CPDL FOR THESE TWO CASES!**
--> I think I got it, the sign that I thought was some weird kind fo mensuration change or a mistake or chord thing is actually a semibreve (well, two semibreves on top of each other, one in D and one in B), and that is just in the place where CPDL adds a semibreve Bflat (flat so that is the same as the Bass). It could be either a D or a Bflat semibreve (with the flat ficta-ed). Is it a chord??? (doesn't make sense to be a chord because it is just one voice, but either pitches would be alright). D would make more sense because then the jump is smaller (of a fifth), and a jump of a fifth makes more sense than a jump of a seventh, and then the movement to E after a short rest.

-> SO, OMR CORRECTION (actually kept the chord in the voice with B and D, we have two custodes for those two pitches in the previous system too).

### Section 4 (Et in spiritus)

Editorial corrections:
- Shorten the last note in the Bassus
- Extend minim to a semibreve in Tenor (measure 5 from the end)
 **[IN CPDL, THEY LEFT IT AS IT WAS AND, INSTEAD, THEY JUST EXTENDED THE LAST NOTE OF THE TENOR (TO COVER THE REST OF THE MEASURE BY BEING A MINIM LONGER) - I THINK MY SOLUTION IS BETTER, BUT I WILL HAVE TO CHECK HOW MANY ORANGE LABELS DOES IT REMOVE]**

No remaining orange labels after editorial corrections



## Sanctus
### Full Movement

Editorial corrections: not really
- Extend last note in the Altus (section 1)

Remaining orange labels after editorial corrections:
- Two in the Tenor (section 2), **rearticulations**
- One in the Altus (same measure, section 2), **? - it is forming a fourth with the bass, so that is illegal - maybe move it down a second so that the illegal dissonance dissapears and that it has the same pitch as the minims preceding and following??? - AND THEN ALL ILLEGAL DISSON DISSAPEAR COMPLETELY**


## Agnus Dei I
### Full Movement

Editorial corrections:
- Extend the notes of the four voices for simultaneous ending (section 1) [only orange labels left are 2, which are in super-weak beats]
- Section 2 is missing a minim in the Altus:
 - Change the A minim to a semibreve (section 2, measure 6) [**THIS IS THE CPDL CORRECTION, which lets two unexplained orange labels**]
 - I did another type of correction (see MENSURAL_SCORE2), where the A minim is kept, but I added a minim before. This added C minim resolved the suspension generated by the previous D semibreve. This change left **no orange labels**.
- Extend the last notes in Superius, Altus, and Bassus (section 2)



## Agnus Dei II
### Full Movement

Completed (thesis feedback: extending last notes in altus and bassus, and only one orange label left which is ignored as it is in a weak beat).



CPDL COMMENTS
09.01	Identical, except for the passage in Christe's tenor (four measures before the end) where the semiminims are in triplets in cpdl (reducing things by a minim). You achieved this reduction by reducing an F semibreve---located two notes before---to a minim. --> CONSULT
09.02.01	Identical
09.02.02	Identical
09.03.01	Identical
09.03.02	Identical (No real difference, just last notes)
*09.03.03	Diffs (see COMMENTS above) --> CONSULT
09.03.04	Diffs (see COMMENTS above) --> CONSULT
09.04	The pitch-related editorial correction (to remove the fourth above the bass) is not done in cpdl (might not be important, maybe take it out) --> CONSULT*
09.05	Which solution is better? CPDL or mine? --> CONSULT
09.06	Thesis
