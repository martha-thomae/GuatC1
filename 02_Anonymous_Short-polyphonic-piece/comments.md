# Piece 02 (f.04v-07r) - Asperges me - Anonymous

***Sections 1 & 2 have a cantus firmus that is supposed to go two times as fast (given that it has a C-cut sign, while the other voices have a regular C sign).
Because of this, rather than leaving it in breve values, I used semibreve values to achieve the "two times faster" tempo***

## Section 1

Editorial corrections: not really
- Change cantus firmus (tenor) to only semibreves (except for last note)
- Only shorten the last note of the altus and bassus

Only one orange label left, **rearticulation**


## Section 2

Editorial corrections: not really
- Change cantus firmus (tenor) to only semibreves
- Extend last note in the tenor & Shorten the last note in altus

Two orange labels left, one in **weak beat** (upper voice i) and one **duplicating the agent's pitch class** (a C minim in bassus that is already sounding as a semibreve in the tenor).


## Section 3

No editorial corrections needed

Two orange labels, both are **rearticulations**
