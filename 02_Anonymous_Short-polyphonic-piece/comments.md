## Section 1

Editorial corrections: not really
- Change cantus firmus (tenor) to only semibreves (except for last note)
- Only shorten the last note of the altus and bassus

Only one orange label left, **rearticulation**


## Section 2

Editorial corrections: not really
- Change cantus firmus (tenor) to only semibreves
- Extend last note in the tenor & Shorten the last note in altus

Two orange labels left, one in weak beat (upper voice i) and one duplicating the C agent (C minim in bassus) that is already sounding as a semibreve in the tenor.


## Section 3

No editorial corrections needed

Two orange labels, both are **rearticulations**
