# Piece 04 (f.11v-14r) - Vidi aquam - [Hernando Franco]

## Section 1

Editorial corrections: not really
- Extend last note (Altus)

Remaining orange labels
- One in the superius, **rearticulation**
- One in the tenor, **another agent** (G semibreve in bassus is an agent for the C in the superius, and the D minim in the tenor could also act as a agent of that C in the superius---it has an orange 'y' because it is sounding against that suspended note tagged with a blue 's', while another note [the bass G] is tagged as its agent with a blue 'g')


## Section 2

No editorial corrections
- Caught one MuRET error (the three-note ligature in Superius is one second down)

No remaining orange labels
