# Piece 03 (f.07v-11r) - Vidi aquam - Pedro Bermudez

Notes:
- Cantus firmus in tenor (in all three sections) - so all semibreves
- Cut-C in tenor vs. C in other voices (section 1)


## Section 1

Editorial corrections:
- Change cantus firmus (tenor) to only semibreves
- Extend the last note in the tenor
- Change ligature in the superius to c.o.p.

Remaining orange labels after editorial corrections:
- Two in the altus, both **rearticulations**
- And three in the superius, one is a **rearticulation**, and the other two are **???**

Needed to change triplet group to just two minims just to work in the MP Editor (which doesn't handle triplets), and then turned it back to triplets offline.


## Section 2

Editorial corrections: not really
- Change cantus firmus (tenor) to only semibreves, with the last note a breve

No remaining orange labes


## Section 3

Editorial corrections:
- Change cantus firmus (tenor) to only semibreves
- Shorten the last note in the superius & extend the last note in the tenor

Remaining orange labels:
- Two orange labels in the bassus, both are **rearticulations**

**CONSULT: It sounds as unfinished.**
