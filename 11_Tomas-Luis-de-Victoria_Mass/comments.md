# Mass 11 (f.85v-95r) - Missa O quam gloriosum - Victoria



## Kyrie
### Full Movement

Extend or shorten the last notes in all foru voices in Christe section

Remaining orange labels: all rearticulations

---

## Gloria
### Section 1

Editorial corrections: cut semibreve to minim in tenor before cadence

Tied minims in tenor (measures 6-7), subtituted by semibreve [no ties in MuRET]

And added two accidentals I missed in MuRET (measures 10 and 12, Tenor)

One remaining orange label (seems to be part of a chord)


### Section 2

No editorial corrections

Remaining orange labels: Other than rearticulations, only one in the Superius (see screenshot)

---

## Credo
### Section 1

Had to add an ending to the bassus (a breve and semibreve rest after the mensuration sign like in the other vioces), otherwise, the piece would never line up in the score editor and it would be hard to see the true illegal dissonances (as in score editor, one cannot add notes after a change in mensuration sign).

Then I saw the true illegal dissonances and edit based on that.

Editorial correction:
- dot a minim (the dot is actualy in the manuscript, but it is not next to the minim, but in the next system)
- add the ending of bassus as an editorial corr

Remaining: three = two in altus + one in tenor (see screenshot) --> SCRATCH THAT, ALL OF THESE WERE DUE TO A WEIRD CHANGE IN CLEF THAT I DIDN'T CATCH IN MURET. NOW ALL THE ORANGE LABELS ARE REARTICULATIONS.


### Section 2

Revised and all good (first divided into two for the triple meter part and the going back to the duple meter)


### Section 3

Correction: Add a semibreve rest in tenor (at the beginning of the third system, after the starting breve). It might have been in the manuscript, but there is a hole in the area.

Orange labels left after the corrections: just two, both rearticulations.

---

## Sanctus
### Section 1 (Sanctus)

No editorial corrections

Remaining orange labels: two, both in super-weak beats


### Section 2 (Osanna) - Triple meter section

No editorial corrections (replace two colored minims by two semiminims as I saw by the barring in the MP Editor these were not meant to be colored notes)

---

## Agnus
### Full Movement

No editorial corrections.

The only orange labels left are doubling the agent.
