## Credo
### Section 1

Had to add an ending to the bassus (a breve and semibreve rest after the mensuration sign like in the other vioces), otherwise, the piece would never line up in the score editor and it would be hard to see the true illegal dissonances (as in score editor, one cannot add notes after a change in mensuration sign).

Then I saw the true illegal dissonances and edit based on that.

Editorial correction:
- dot a minim (the dot is actualy in the manuscript, but it is not next to the minim, but in the next system)
- add the ending of bassus as an editorial corr

Remaining: three = two in altus + one in tenor (see screenshot)
