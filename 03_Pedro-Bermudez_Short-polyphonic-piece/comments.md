# Piece 02 (f.04v-07r) - Asperges me - Anonymous

***Sections 1 & 2 have a cantus firmus that is supposed to go two times as fast (given that it has a C-cut sign, while the other voices have a regular C sign).
Because of this, rather than leaving it in breve values, I used semibreve values to achieve the "two times faster" tempo***

## Section 1

Editorial corrections:
- Change cantus firmus (tenor) to only semibreves
- Extend the last note in the tenor
- Change ligature in the superius to c.o.p.

Remaining orange labels after editorial corrections:
- Two in the altus, both **rearticulations**
- And three in the superius, one is a **rearticulation**, and the other two are **???**

Needed to change triplet group to just two minims just to work in the MP Editor (which doesn't handle triplets), and then turned it back to triplets offline.

## Section 2



## Section 3
