# Piece 18 (f.180v-181r) - Christus natus est - Pedro Bermudez


Editorial corrections:
- Add dot to second semibreve (Altus) in Section 2
- Shorten the last note (superius) and extend the last note (altus) in Section 2

No orange labels remaining after editorial corrections

Section 1 sounds good now that you added the editorial accidental.

Section 2, however, doesn't sound good with or without the editorial accidentals. Probably the editodrial corrections are wrong. CHECK!!!
