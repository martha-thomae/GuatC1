### Section 1 (Et in terra pax)

Editorial correction:
- Missing dot in minim (measure 22), preceding a semiminim (for a rhythm of dotted minim + semiminim that is in other places). The dot is actually present in the manuscript, but it is not next to the minim that ends the system, instead it is at the start of the following system.

One orange label due to a **fourth above the bass (the bass has a D, and the superius has a semibreve G sounding at the same time). This is also a G chord in third inversion**.


### Section 2 (Qui tollis peccata mundi)

No editorial corrections

Remaining orange labels:
- seventh chord at the begining, 4 rearticulations, **fourth above the bass but part of an F triad**, and another seventh chord at the end
