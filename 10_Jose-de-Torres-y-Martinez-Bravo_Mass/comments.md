## Kyrie
### Full Movement

Thesis


## Gloria
### Section 1 (Et in terra pax)

Editorial correction:
- Missing dot in minim (measure 22), preceding a semiminim (for a rhythm of dotted minim + semiminim that is in other places). The dot is actually present in the manuscript, but it is not next to the minim that ends the system, instead it is at the start of the following system.

One orange label due to a **fourth above the bass (the bass has a D, and the superius has a semibreve G sounding at the same time). This is also a G chord in third inversion**.


### Section 2 (Qui tollis peccata mundi)

No editorial corrections

Remaining orange labels:
- seventh chord at the begining, 4 rearticulations, **fourth above the bass but part of an F triad**, and another seventh chord at the end


## Credo 
### Section 1 & 2 (Patrem omnipotentem & Et incarnatus est)


### Sections 3 (Crucifixus)
No editorial corrections

Remaining orange labels explained in thesis: either part of a chord or doubling the agent


### Section 4 (Et in spiritus)



## Sanctus
### Full Movement

Editorial corrections:
- Add a dot to a minim preceding a semiminim to fix the barring in Bassus (section 1). The dot can be seen in the manuscript, but it is not immediately follow the minim. The minim is at the end of a system, and the dot is at the beginning of the next system.
- Switch the sequence: semiminim + dot + minim. Now it is minim + dot + semiminim, which reads as dotted minim and semiminim. And this adds the fusa that was missing in the voice (Altus, section 2).

Remaining orange labels after editorial corrections;
- Two in Altus, section 2, **?**
- Others are **rearticulations**
