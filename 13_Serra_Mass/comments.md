1.1 
- Extend last notes.

1.1-3
- Also other editorial corrections needed according to CPDL.

2.1
OMR error, missing a dot after the last minim of the 9th system in 112r (bassus). The dot happens at the beginning of the next system (10th) just before the first note (a semiminim)


2.2
Extend last note in altus to finish with other voices (lots of orange labels due to rearticulations, and maybe others are acceptable)


3.1
No corrections (as corroborated in CPDL's version – identical).

3.2
No corrections (as corroborated in CPDL's version – identical).

3.3
Scribal error (system 10 of f.144v), a semibreve in the tenor was supposed to be a minim. Orange labels (that were not rearrticulations) helped find the area, as soon as I clicked on the notes in that area I could see the correction in the mss added by a second hand, so I just edit that note and the orange labels (except for one **rearticulation** 'y' in the superius) dissapeared.

3.4
No corrections ... In cpdl the ending is changed a bit (four measures before the end in superius [pitch change], altus [rhythmic change], and bass [ rhythmic change]).

Altus and tenor short by a semiminim (quarter) note: 
- Altus missing a dot that affects the last minim of the 1st system of f.118r by appearing in the next system just before the semiminima.
- Same with tenor. At the beginning of the 9th system of f.117v there is a dot (just preceding the first semiminima) that affects the last minim of the previous (8th) system.

Only one orange label remaining: **rearticulation** in altus.

Perfect match with CPDL's version.

No corrections? cpdl has some differences.
