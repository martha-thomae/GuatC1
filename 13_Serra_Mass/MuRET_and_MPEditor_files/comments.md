# Mass 13

## M13.1.1 
- Extend last notes.

## M13.1.1-3
- Also other editorial corrections needed according to CPDL.

## M13.2.1
- OMR error, missing a dot after the last minim of the 9th system in 112r (bassus). The dot happens at the beginning of the next system (10th) just before the first note (a semiminim)


## M13.2.2
- Extend last note in altus to finish with other voices (lots of orange labels due to rearticulations, and maybe others are acceptable)


## M13.3.1
- No corrections (as corroborated in CPDL's version – identical).

## M13.3.2
- No corrections (as corroborated in CPDL's version – identical).

## M13.3.3
- Scribal error (system 10 of f.144v), a semibreve in the tenor was supposed to be a minim. Orange labels (that were not rearrticulations) helped find the area, as soon as I clicked on the notes in that area I could see the correction in the mss added by a second hand, so I just edit that note and the orange labels (except for one **rearticulation** 'y' in the superius) dissapeared.

## M13.3.4
- No corrections ... In cpdl the ending is changed a bit (four measures before the end in superius [pitch change], altus [rhythmic change], and bass [ rhythmic change]).


## M13.4
- Altus and tenor short by a semiminim (quarter) note: 
    - Altus missing a dot that affects the last minim of the 1st system of f.118r by appearing in the next system just before the semiminima.
    - Same with tenor. At the beginning of the 9th system of f.117v there is a dot (just preceding the first semiminima) that affects the last minim of the previous (8th) system.

- Only one orange label remaining: **rearticulation** in altus.

- Perfect match with CPDL's version.


## M13.5
- No corrections? cpdl has some differences.
