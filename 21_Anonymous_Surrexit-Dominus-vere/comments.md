# Piece 21

## Section 1

Editorial corrections:
- Shorten last note in the altus
- Add a dot on a minim (second minim in the bassus)
- Move the second breve in the four-note ligature up by a second [Gen's edit that removes the last weird dissonances you pointed out in the images folder]

Remaining orange labels after corrections:
- Close to the end of the tenor, **rearticulation**
- Close to the beginning of the tenor, **doubling the agent's pitch** (the G in the Superius)


## Section 2

Editorial corrections:
- Change the ending long of a ligature to a breve (for the cadence at the end to match and all the orange labels being removed in the Superius)
- Shorten the last note in tenor and bassus
- Add a dot after the second to last semibreve in the second staff of the bass (where there is a hole)
- Move the last note of the second two-note ligature one step up [this removes the last passage with lots of orange labels in the images folder]

No remaining orange labels after editorial corrections
